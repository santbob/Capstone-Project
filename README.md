# Capstone-Project
Final Project for the Android Nanodegree @ Udacity

# Pivot
[Capstone Stage 1](https://github.com/santbob/Capstone-Project/blob/master/Capstone_Stage1.pdf) was how the app was planned, but once started implemented it, i soon realized it might not be the best design to do given the data i have access to. Like one 3 images are given by yelp ( which is the only source i was depending on)

Also other considerations like, if i am going to show only 5 recommendation i might as well show quick glances first and if they want to see details they can always click on the item to choose more.

Hence i pivoted from original design and built [Capstone Stage 2](Capstone_Stage2.pdf)

# Future Changes

1. Ability to create groups.
2. Ability to vote among groups to choose a restaurant.
3. Ability to add back restaurant to the recommendations without having to wait for 5 days.
